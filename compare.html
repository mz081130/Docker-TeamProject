            <h2>What are the Differences between Virtualization and Containerization? </h2>
               <p> Containerization is much more efficient than virtualization. With containerization, there is no guest OS to utilize a host’s OS. It is all through the abstraction of OS. Since it is so lightweight, it only takes a fraction of a second to boot up. It will also work across bare-metal systems, cloud instances and virtual machines. </p>

<h1> What are the Differences between Virtualization and Containerization? </h1>

<p> Virtualization, on a single physical server, allows you to run multiple OS. Where as Containerization uses a single VM or server to run multiple apps using the same OS. </p>

<p> As mentioned previously, containerization is much faster than virtualization. With the OS already running, the container is able to start right away. VMs have to start up the entire OS. Virtualization can also run slow due to an increased use in processing power and RAM. </p>

<p> Virtual machines are known to have a longer lifecycle so they are best used in long periods. Containers, which have a short lifecycle, are good for tasks that will not take long. Since they have a much faster startup time, this makes them ideal for a shorter use case. </p>

<p> Virtualization is also not portable. Containerization is meant to run anywhere- it can also be built and shipped anywhere as well. </p>

<p> Compared to virtual machines, containers are less secure. VM’s give complete isolation for all of the applications it hosts where containers only give process level isolation. </p>

<p> But all in all, containerization can be thought of as a lightweight version of virtualization. </p>
